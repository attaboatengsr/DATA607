### Overview

The following shows a country's soccer team ranking based on it's offensive and 
defensive stats as well as it's Sport Power Index (SPI)

---


```{r echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)


path <- "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/club/spi_global_rankings.csv";
download.file(url=path, destfile = "spi_global_rankings.csv");

glb_intl_rk <- read.csv("spi_global_rankings.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE);


kable(glb_intl_rk, col.names = c("rank"="Rank",
                      "prev_rank"="Previous Rank",
                       "name" = "Club",
                      "league"="League",
                      "off"="Offense",
                      "def"="Defense",
                      "spi"="SPI"))


ggplot(glb_intl_rk, aes(x = league)) +
  geom_bar() + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

### Conclusion

Based on the data, it looks like the MLS the league with the most ranked teams for SPI. It could be possible that it the league with the most teams but that will need to be investigated.
